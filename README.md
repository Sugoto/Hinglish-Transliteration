# Indic Language NLP 🌐📊📝
Indic Language NLP is a Python-based solution for natural language processing tasks for Indic languages. It includes a variety of tools and models for tasks such as language identification 🌐, named entity recognition 📊, part-of-speech tagging 📝, sentiment analysis 🤔, and more. The repository contains code samples, documentation, and data resources that can be used to build and customize these models for different languages and domains.

## Features
Here are some of the main features of Indic Language NLP:

### Language Identification 🌐
Indic Language NLP includes models for identifying the language, word-by-word, of a given input text. It currently supports several Indic languages such as Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, and more.

### Transliteration 🌟
Indic Language NLP includes models for transliteration, which can convert text from one script to another. It currently supports Hindi-English code mixed text transliteration, but can be extended to support other languages as well.

### Named Entity Recognition (WIP🏗️) 📊
Indic Language NLP includes models for named entity recognition (NER), which can identify and classify entities such as people, organizations, locations, and more in a given input text. It supports several Indic languages and can be trained on custom datasets for specific domains.

### Part-of-Speech Tagging (WIP🏗️) 📝
Indic Language NLP includes models for part-of-speech (POS) tagging, which can identify and tag the parts of speech in a given input text. It supports several Indic languages and can be trained on custom datasets for specific domains.

### Sentiment Analysis (WIP🏗️) 🤔
Indic Language NLP includes models for sentiment analysis, which can classify the sentiment of a given input text as positive, negative, or neutral. It supports several Indic languages and can be trained on custom datasets for specific domains.

## Models and Datasets 🧰
Indic Language NLP provides pre-trained models and datasets that can be used out-of-the-box for several tasks. The repository also includes resources for training custom models on specific domains and languages.

## Usage 🚀
Indic Language NLP is a code pipeline designed for performing natural language processing tasks on Indic languages. The code is available in a Google Colab notebook, which can be accessed by opening the notebook in Colab and running the cells in order.
