# Hinglish Transliteration

Hinglish Transliteration provides a simple solution to transliterate Hindi-English code mixed text into Roman script using Python. It leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the most appropriate Romanized representation of Hindi-English mixed words and phrases, thus enabling users to read and write Hindi-English code mixed using the English alphabet. The repository contains code samples, documentation, and data resources that can be used to build transliteration models for other languages as well. Hinglish-Transliteration is a valuable resource for anyone interested in natural language processing and cross-linguistic communication.
